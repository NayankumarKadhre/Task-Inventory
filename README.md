# Task-Inventory

The Task Inventory Management project is a web application designed to provide users with a convenient and intuitive interface for managing their tasks effectively. It utilizes a range of modern technologies including EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Git, and MongoDB Atlas to deliver a seamless user experience.

The primary objective of this project is to enable users to easily add tasks, set their priority, difficulty, and time period, and store them securely in a database. By leveraging the power of Node.js and Express, the web application allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is used as the templating engine, enabling the dynamic generation of HTML pages based on user interactions.

The project utilizes MongoDB as the backend database, with Mongoose serving as an elegant object modeling tool.

Upon accessing the app, users are greeted with a simple yet intuitive interface. The clean and user-friendly design enables users to quickly navigate through the application's features. The task creation process is straightforward, providing fields for adding task details such as the task name, priority, difficulty level, and desired time period. Once entered, the task is saved to the database, ensuring that it can be accessed at any time.

In addition to task creation, the application also supports task deletion. Users can effortlessly remove tasks from their inventory when they are completed or no longer needed. The project leverages the power of Git for version control, enabling seamless collaboration and ensuring that changes made to the codebase can be easily tracked and managed.
